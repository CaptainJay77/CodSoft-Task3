# CodSoft-Task3
This project is part of my internship at CodSoft, where I was tasked with creating a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim of this project is to build a simple yet functional calculator that can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
